## Code Samples
Most of my back-end work has been private, so I can't show a lot of it.  

- [featureFlags.js](featureFlags.js) - a simple utility wrapping a cookie or server-side props (behind another utility: @rei/server-prop)
- [RefactorToFunctionalStyle.kt](RefactorToFunctionalStyle.kt) - A refactor of [a mapper that didn't use a functional approach](before/BeforeRefactorToFunctionalStyle.kt)
- [Range.tsx](Range.tsx) - a simple React component that styles an [`<input type="range">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range)
- [RunningHiker.scss](RunningHiker.scss) - SASS css3 animation for an svg sprite, mimicing running.  
- [Concept piece](https://github.com/LittleUmbrella/LittleUmbrella.github.io) (code is rough/oldish - don't judge!) - I've always been fascinated by drag-n-drop.  In the sci-fi movies/shows, you see these holographic UIs where the users are always dragging and dropping.  But how practical is it?  Well, holograms are a bit out there, so I thought about how to do it with standard web tech.  I actually had the opportunity to build a small POC for BECU using the framework.
- [Gatsby + Redux-Saga starter](https://github.com/LittleUmbrella/gatsby-typescript-redux-saga-poc) - [see README](https://github.com/LittleUmbrella/gatsby-typescript-redux-saga-poc/blob/master/README.md)
